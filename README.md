## Struggles
1. I had challenges figuring out the structure of the images on both the home page and the Signup page. I did not use any tools and I had limited time to figure out what tools are available out there to use.
2. I can write the label and input part of a form but still need more learning when it comes to css design of a form.( this to do with sizing and placing the margin at the appropriate location on the Webpage or application.
 

## Bugs

1. The Webpage responsive to different devices failed
2. the navigation bar from contact page to home failed

## Reference
1. Slack Community have been tremediously helpful
2. W3school
3. Code Institute Challenges 
4. Google browser
